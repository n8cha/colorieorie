## ColorieRetro

This is an adaptation of the original
[Colorie theme](https://github.com/ronv/colorie), made to look slightly retro.
Currently, it's also serving as the theme for my personal website and thus
contains strictly personalized components. Will segment out personal components
from retro ones in future version.

### Main Changes
- new favicon
- new font [(IBM Plex Sans)](https://github.com/IBM/plex)
- retro-ish color scheme
- some font weight/case adjustments
- hover bolding for nav bar
- hide the vertical scrollbar
- (all changes defined in commit history)
